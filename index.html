        <p>I have been practicing design for over 10 years and am constantly striving to develop and execute impactful work that informs the viewer in meaningful ways. I believe that research, empathy, and collaboration lead to brilliant design solutions.

          <img src="images/BPL_ArtsCulture.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The department wanted to reach more donors and patrons and show the full extent of programing that is happening through out the library system. I designed a quarterly magazine to not only feature program listings but to also include editorial content providing more value to our patrons.</p>

          <h3>Project 2</h3>
          <img src="images/BPL_ReadingKit.jpg" alt="">
          <p>After receiving a grant the department wanted to reprint and create new materials for toddlers and parents. I wanted to package these materials in a tidy and cute way. I worked with printers to prototype and create the dieline for the kit box. It holds materials snuggly and stacks well so it can be shipped easily and efficiently.</p>

          <h3>Project 3</h3>
          <img src="images/New_Year_Resolutions_Kit.jpg" alt="">
          <p>New Year's Resolution Starter Kit was given out in the beginning of the year to help people with their finances. I designed the box, product cards, and Infographic. The infographic lives on their site and breaks down peoples financial goals while giving them tips on how to save.</p>
